# iOS Base Template
**iOS base** is a boilerplate project created by Rootstrap for new projects using Swift 5. The main objective is helping any new projects jump start into feature development by providing a handful of functionalities.

## Features
This template comes with:
#### Main
- Extensible and decoupled integration with an **API Client** to easily communicate with **REST services**.
- A few examples to **comprehend the app architecture**(e.g. Account creation, Login, Logout)
- Useful classes to **manage User and Session data**.
- **Secure** way to store and manage secret keys of your **third party integrations**.
- Centralized and intuitive **navigation system** that simplifies the transitioning between view controllers and streamlines the navigation flow within the app.
- Convenient **helpers** and **extensions** to boost your productivity and improve the general coding experience.

## How to use
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `./init` from the recently created folder.
3. Initialize a new git repo and add your remote URL.
4. Done!

To manage user and session persistence after the original sign in/up we store that information in the native UserDefaults. The parameters that we save are due to the usage of [Devise Token Auth](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/devise_token_auth) for authentication on the server side. Suffice to say that this can be modified to be on par with the server authentication of your choice.

## Dependencies
#### Main
 - [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) for easy and elegant connection with an API.
 - [IQKeyboardManagerSwift](https://github.com/hackiftekhar/IQKeyboardManager) for auto-scrolling to current input in long views.
    Note: this pod is not fully working on iOS 11. [Here](https://github.com/hackiftekhar/IQKeyboardManager/issues/972) is the issue we encountered and the meantime solution.
 - [Firebase](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk) for tools to help you build, grow and monetize your app.

#### Utilities

We have developed other libraries that can be helpful and you could integrate with the dependency manager of your choice.

- **[PagedLists:](https://github.com/rootstrap/PagedLists)** Custom `UITableView` and `UICollectionView` classes to easily handle pagination.
- **[RSFontSizes:](https://github.com/rootstrap/RSFontSizes)** allows you to manage different font sizes for every device screen size in a flexible manner.
- **[RSFormView:](https://github.com/rootstrap/RSFormView)** a library that helps you to build fully customizable forms for data entry in a few minutes.
- **[SwiftGradients:](https://github.com/rootstrap/SwiftGradients)** Useful extensions for `UIViews` and `CALayer` classes to add beautiful color gradients.


#### Testing
 - [KIF](https://github.com/kif-framework/KIF) for UI testing.
 - [KIF/IdentifierTests](https://github.com/kif-framework/KIF) to have access to accesibility identifiers.

## Mandatory configuration
#### Firebase

In order for the project to run, you have to follow these steps:
1. Register your app with Firebase.
2. Download Firebase configuration file `GoogleService-Info.plist` from your account.
3. Add the downloaded file to the <main-source-folder>/Resources folder.
4. Done :)

See the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup) for more information.

## Code Quality Standards
In order to meet the required code quality standards, this project runs [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint)
during the build phase and reports warnings/errors directly through XCode.

**NOTE:** It's needed to install [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) into your local machine to report warnings/errors.

The current SwiftLint rule configuration is based on [Rootstrap's Swift style guides](https://rootstrap.github.io/swift) and is synced with
the CodeCliemate's configuration file.

**NOTE:** Make sure you have SwiftLint version 0.35.0 or greater installed to avoid known false-positives with some of the rules.

## Security recommendations

### Secrets management

We strongly recommend that all private keys be added to a `secrets.xcconfig` file that will remain locally and not be committed to your project repo.

#### Adding new secrets
1. Add the new environment variable in your system:
   - Optional: For local development, you can run `export KEY=value` in the terminal.
      _Or you could start with a pre-filled secrets.dev.xcconfig file._
   - In your CI/CD platform, simply add the environment variable with its value to the respective settings section.
2. Add the new key name to the `keys.env` file.
   _This could be any other file you use as source for the script mentioned in the next step._
3. Configure your CI/CD to run:
   - `chmod u+x setup-env.sh`
   - `./setup-env.sh`
4. Add the key to the Info.plist of your app's target.
   _Example: ThirdPartyKey = ${THIRD_PARTY_KEY}_
5. Add a new case to the `Secret.Key` enum.
   _The rawValue must match the key in the Info.plist file_
6. Use it wisely :)

**Note:** The `setup-env` script will fill in the `secrets.xcconfig` for Staging and Release builds.
Use `secrets.dev.xcconfig` for the `Debug` Build Configuration.

#### Secure storage

We recommend using [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) for storing `.xcconfig` files containing all secrets, as well as any other sensitive files. Alternatively when not using Fastlane Match (eg might not be compatible with some CICD systems), AWS S3 can also be used for storing Certificates, Private Keys and Profiles required for app signing. The CICD code examples (described below) make use of the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) to download any files relevant for our project from a predefined bucket and folder 

Another alternative for managing sensitive files whithin the repo using Git-Secret can be found in the [**feature/git-secret**](https://github.com/rootstrap/ios-base/tree/feature/jenkins) branch 

## CI/CD configuration with Bitrise (updated on Dec 12th 2021)

We are going to start using a tool called Bitrise to configure de CI/CD pipelines for mobiles apps.

--> For iOS apps you can find how to do it in this link: https://www.notion.so/rootstrap/iOS-CI-CD-01e00409a0144f5b85212bf889c627dd


## Automated Build and Deployment using Fastlane  (DEPRECATED)

We use [Fastlane](https://docs.fastlane.tools) to automate code signing, building and release to TestFlight. 

See details in [Fastlane folder](fastlane/README.md).

## Continuous Integration / Delivery (DEPRECATED)

We recommend [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for integrating Fastlane into a CI/CD pipeline. You can find two workflows in the GitHub workflows folder:
* [ci.yml](.github/workflows/release.myl)       : triggered on any push and PR, runs unit tests, coverage report and static analysis with [CodeClimate](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate)
* [release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml)  : triggered on push to specific branches, builds, signs and submits to TestFlight

Alternatively you can merge branch [**feature/jenkins**](https://github.com/rootstrap/ios-base/tree/feature/jenkins) for some equivalent CICD boilerplate with **Jenkins**.

On both alternatives we assume usage of Fastlane match for managing signing Certificates and Profiles, and AWS S3 for storing other files containing third-party keys
