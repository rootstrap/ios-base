# iOS Base Template
**iOS base** is a boilerplate project created by Rootstrap for new projects using Swift 5. The main objective is helping any new projects jump start into feature development by providing a handful of functionalities.

## Features
This template comes with:
#### Main
- Complete **API service** class to easily communicate with **REST services**.
- Examples for **account creation** and **Facebook integration**.
- Useful classes to **manage User and Session data**.
- **Secure** way to store keys of your **third party integrations**.
- Handy **helpers** and **extensions** to make your coding experience faster and easier.


#### Extensions
 This App Template also contains other branches with specific features that may be of use to you:

- [**feature/observe_root_vc**](https://github.com/rootstrap/ios-base/tree/feature/observe_root_vc): Detecting when **rootViewController** gets loaded.
- [**feature/util_gradients**](https://github.com/rootstrap/ios-base/tree/feature/util_gradients): Helper methods to easily add **color gradients**.
- [**feature/paginated_collections**](https://github.com/rootstrap/ios-base/tree/feature/paginated_collections): Adds **paginated** subclasses of **UITableView** and **UICollectionView**.
- [**feature/mvvm+rxswift**](https://github.com/rootstrap/ios-base/tree/feature/mvvm%2Brxswift) in case you want to work with **RxSwift** and **MVVM**.

To use them simply download the branch and locally rebase against master/develop from your initial **iOS base** clone.
**Important**: See steps below on how to install this features.

## How to use
1. Clone repo.
2. Install desired extensions from their branches.
3. Run `swift init.swift` from the recently created folder.
4. Initialize a new git repo and add your remote url.
5. Done!

To manage user and session persistence after the original sign in/up we store that information in the native UserDefaults. The parameters that we save are due to the usage of [Devise Token Auth](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/devise_token_auth) for authentication on the server side. Suffice to say that this can be modified to be on par with the server authentication of your choice.

## Pods
#### Main
 - [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) for easy and elegant connection with an API.
 - [IQKeyboardManagerSwift](https://github.com/hackiftekhar/IQKeyboardManager) for auto-scrolling to current input in long views.
    Note: this pod is not fully working on iOS 11. [Here](https://github.com/hackiftekhar/IQKeyboardManager/issues/972) is the issue we encountered and the meantime solution.


#### Testing
 - [KIF](https://github.com/kif-framework/KIF) for UI testing.
 - [KIF/IdentifierTests](https://github.com/kif-framework/KIF) to have access to accesibility identifiers.
 - [OHHTTPStubs/Swift](https://github.com/AliSoftware/OHHTTPStubs) for network testing.

#### Optional
 - [FBSDKCoreKit](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk) facebook pods dependency.
 - [FBSDKLoginKit](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk) for facebook login.

## Optional configuration
#### facebook
1. In `info.plist` on the URL types array, find `fbXXXXXXXXXXX` and replace it for the string "fb" + the ID of your app. i.e: `fb435272928934`.
2. Change the `FacebookAppID` value for the same AppID that you replace above.
3. Change the `FacebookDisplayName` value for the name of the app on Facebook.
4. Done :)

## Security recommendations
#### Third Party Keys

We strongly recommend that all private keys be added to a `.plist` file that will remain locally and not be committed to your project repo. An example file is already provided, these are the final steps to set it up:

1. Rename the `ThirdPartyKeys.example.plist` file on your project so that it is called `ThirdPartyKeys.plist`.
  To add a set of keys simply add a dictionary with the name you want the key to have and add the corresponding **Debug**, **Staging** and **Release** keys as items.
2. Remove the reference of `ThirdPartyKeys.plist` from XCode but do not delete the file. This way, you will keep the file locally(it is already in the .gitignore list) in the project directory.
  **Note: Do NOT move the file from the current location, the script uses the $(PROJECT_DIR) directory.**
3. Go to **Product** -> **Scheme** -> **Edit scheme**. Then select **Pre-actions** for the Build stage and make sure that the `Provided build setting` is set to your current target.
**Repeat this step for the Post-actions script.**
4. Done :)
